# Yatzy Kata

This Refactoring Kata was designed by Jon Jagger and is available in his Cyber-Dojo. See [his blog post](http://jonjagger.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/yahtzee-cyber-dojo-refactoring-in-java.html)

I'll do my best to refacto project's java/javascript code to make this legacy code cleaner and more maintainable ;)
